Regression - Linear Regression
			

Classification - 
		Naive Bayes
		Support Vector Machine (SVM)
		Decision Trees
		Random Forest
		Logistic Regression


Recommonding Relevant products to a user:
	Colloborating Filtering
		Alternative Least Squares
		Nearest Neighbour model
	Association Rules:
		Content Based Filtering
		
Clustering:
	K-Means
	Hierarchial Clustering
	Density-based Clustering
	Distribution-based Clustering


Represent Data:
--------------
	Data Munging:
			Most data requires heavy duty pre-processing like identifying and accounting for missing data values, recognizing and fixing corrupt data.
		
	Feature Extraction:
			Data is oftern unstructured and semantically complex
			Natural Language Processing - is used for Text
			Image and Video processing 
			
	Feature Engineering:
			Feature Engineering is an informal field, we may need to construct more relvant features from a raw set of features.
	
	Dimensionality  Reduction: Dimensionality reduction refers to techniques that reduce the number of input variables in a dataset.



Model Seleciton:
----------------
	Hyper Parameter Tuning
	Cross Validation
	Ensembling


Chi2 is a measure of dependency between variables - use this relationship to determine the most relevant features for classification

Use the ANOVA F-value as a measure of dependency - use this relationship to determine the most relevant features for classification

Use Chi-Square Tests when every variable you're working with is categorical. Use ANOVA when you have at least one categorical variable and one continuous dependent variable.

Recursive feature Elimination selects features by recursively considering smaller subsets of features by pruning the least important feature at each step.
